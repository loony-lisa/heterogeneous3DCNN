# Het3DCNN
Heterogeneous 3D convolutional network using tensorflow

## 1 Environments:
Tensorflow 1.12.1
Python3
 
## 2 Dataset
Data are saved in tfrecord format.
In this project, input features are: 
* grayscale image
* x direction optical flow
* y direction optical flow
* x direction mbh
* y direction mbh


Data includes only first 10 classes from UCF50. (sorry about the small dataset)

TFrecord files can be downloaded by Google Drive.
